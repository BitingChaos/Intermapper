# Intermapper Probes

## Watchdog 15

If you use the Geist [Watchdog 15](http://www.itwatchdogs.com/temperature-humidity-climate-monitor-watchdog-15-p71) along with Intermapper, you can add this probe to monitor it.

In Intermapper, add a new device, then go to its Probes. Add a new probe, and select the "snmp.watchdog15-probe.txt" file.
It should then add the new probe to Miscellaneous/Watchdog 15.
